The following problems are for those of you looking to challenge yourself beyond the required problem sets and programming questions. They are completely optional and will not be graded. While they vary in level, many are pretty challenging, and we strongly encourage you to discuss ideas and approaches with your fellow students on the "Theory Problems" discussion forum.

    Consider a connected undirected graph GGG with not necessarily distinct edge costs. Consider two different minimum-cost spanning trees of GGG, TTT and T′. Is there necessarily a sequence of minimum-cost spanning trees T=T0,T1,T2,…,Tr=T′ with the property that each consecutive pair Ti,Ti+1T_i,T_{i+1}Ti​,Ti+1​ of MSTs differ by only a single edge swap? Prove the statement or exhibit a counterexample.

    Consider the following algorithm. The input is a connected undirected graph with edge costs (distinct, if you prefer). The algorithm proceeds in iterations. If the current graph is a spanning tree, then the algorithm halts. Otherwise, it picks an arbitrary cycle of the current graph and deletes the most expensive edge on the cycle. Is this algorithm guaranteed to compute a minimum-cost spanning tree? Prove it or exhibit a counterexample.

    Consider the following algorithm. The input is a connected undirected graph with edge costs (distinct, if you prefer). The algorithm proceeds in phases. Each phase adds some edges to a tree-so-far and reduces the number of vertices in the graph (when there is only 1 vertex left, the MST is just the empty set). In a phase, we identify the cheapest edge eve_vev​ incident on each vertex vvv of the current graph. Let F={ev}F = \{ e_v \}F={ev​} be the collection of all such edges in the current phase. Obtain a new (smaller) graph by contracting all of the edges in FFF --- so that each connected component of FFF becomes a single vertex in the new graph --- discarding any self-loops that result. Let TTT denote the union of all edges that ever get contracted in a phase of this algorithm. Is TTT guaranteed to be a minimum-cost spanning tree? Prove it or exhibit a counterexample.
